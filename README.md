# CEW-OEL
"Open Ended Lab for CEW"

The purpose of this open ended lab is to prepare an integrated monitoring system in C, covering a range of fundamental concepts and practical applications. The project involves interacting with a free API (openweathermap API) that provides real-time environmental data. The programs's core functionalities include data retrieval, processing, analysis, and reporting.

"HOW TO RUN"

Make sure to download both main.c and shell.sh file. Create a virtual environment in a directory where both these file reside then use the terminal to compile and run the code. Weather report, raw data, and processed data files will be generated after running the code.
